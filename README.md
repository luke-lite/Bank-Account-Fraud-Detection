# Bank Account Fraud Detection

## Project Goal
The goal of this project is to accurately and responsibly predict fraudulent bank account applications. This will be done by setting a maximum accepted FPR (false positive rate) and optimizing the TPR (true positive rate) within those confines. Additionally, fairness metrics will be used to ensure that the models are not biased against certain protected classes of people.

## Stakeholder
The stakeholder is the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), an independent bureau of the US Department of the Treasury. The OCC is responsible for regulating and supervising all national banks. This project is aimed to assist them in establishing industry standards to ensure banks can effectively identify fraud while protecting consumer interests.
